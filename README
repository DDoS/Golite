## Project structure

We followed the required project structure. Additionally, we
used Gradle to manage building. This means that we have extra
files in the project root to configure the tool. We also have
a couple of `gradlew` scripts to run the build without requiring
a Gradle installation. The `gradle` directory contains the wrapper
and a plugin for SableCC support.

We decided to bundle our extra test cases. They can be found in
the directories `programs/invalid_extra` and `programs/valid_extra`
